Task ID,Task,
T0027,"Conduct analysis of log files, evidence, and other information to determine best methods for identifying the perpetrator(s) of a network intrusion. 
T0036,"Confirm what is known about an intrusion and discover new information, if possible, after identifying intrusion via dynamic analysis. 
T0048,"Create a forensically sound duplicate of the evidence (i.e., forensic image) that ensures the original evidence is not unintentionally modified, to use for data recovery and analysis processes. This includes, but is not limited to, hard drives, floppy diskettes, CDs, PDAs, mobile phones, GPS, and all tape formats. 
T0049,Decrypt seized data using technical means.,
T0075,Provide technical summary of findings in accordance with established reporting procedures.,

T0103,Examine recovered data for information of relevance to the issue at hand.,
T0113,Identify digital evidence for examination and analysis in such a way as to avoid unintentional alteration.,
T0165,"Perform dynamic analysis to boot an “image” of a drive (without necessarily having the original drive) to see the intrusion as the user may have seen it, in a native environment. 
T0167,Perform file signature analysis.,
T0168,Perform hash comparison against established database.,
T0172,"Perform real-time forensic analysis (e.g., using Helix in conjunction with LiveView). 
T0173,Perform timeline analysis.,
T0175,"Perform real-time cyber defense incident handling (e.g., forensic collections, intrusion correlation and tracking, threat analysis, and direct system remediation) tasks to support deployable Incident Response Teams (IRTs). 
T0179,Perform static media analysis.,
T0182,"Perform tier 1, 2, and 3 malware analysis. 
T0190,"Prepare digital media for imaging by ensuring data integrity (e.g., write blockers in accordance with standard operating procedures). 
T0212,Provide technical assistance on digital evidence matters to appropriate personnel.,
T0216,Recognize and accurately report forensic artifacts indicative of a particular operating system.,
T0238,"Extract data using data carving techniques (e.g., Forensic Tool Kit [FTK], Foremost). 
T0240,Capture and analyze network traffic associated with malicious activities using network monitoring tools.,
T0241,"Use specialized equipment and techniques to catalog, document, extract, collect, package, and preserve digital evidence. 
T0253,Conduct cursory binary analysis.,
T0279,Serve as technical expert and liaison to law enforcement personnel and explain incident details as required.,
T0285,Perform virus scanning on digital media.,
T0286,Perform file system forensic analysis.,
T0287,"Perform static analysis to mount an ""image"" of a drive (without necessarily having the original drive). 
T0288,Perform static malware analysis.,
T0289,Utilize deployable forensics toolkit to support operations as necessary.,
T0312,Coordinate with intelligence analysts to correlate threat assessment data. ,
T0396,Process image with appropriate tools depending on analyst’s goals.,
T0397,Perform Windows registry analysis. ,
T0398,Perform file and registry monitoring on the running system after identifying intrusion via dynamic analysis. ,

T0400,Correlate incident data and perform cyber defense reporting. ,
T0401,"Maintain deployable cyber defense toolkit (e.g., specialized cyber defense software/hardware) to support Incident Response Team mission. 
T0432,"Collect and analyze intrusion artifacts (e.g., source code, malware, and system configuration) and use discovered data to enable mitigation of potential cyber defense incidents within the enterprise. 
T0532,"Review forensic images and other data sources (e.g., volatile data) for recovery of potentially relevant information. 
T0546,"Write and publish cyber defense recommendations, reports, and white papers on incident findings to appropriate constituencies.
