    "# Refresh KSATT Open Source Graph Database\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Neo4j Version 4.4.5 was used at time of updating this.\n",
    "\n",
    "While all of these sources are relatively static, they do have version updates (on irregular cadences).  \n",
    "It is not urgent to incorporate these updates, so running these updates should be done monthly or quarterly and require a more significant rebuild of the KSATT graph database as well.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to running this code for the first time, you should:\n",
    "- Ensure you have all python packages installed on your local machine (and optionally in the virtual environment you use to run this).\n",
    "- Create an empty new local Neo4j graph database. \n",
    "  - Start it upon creation, then stop it. \n",
    "  - Install the APOC plugin. \n",
    "  - Edit the settings file so that the minimum and maximum heap sizes are at least 1GB and 3GB respectively.\n",
    "  - You'll need to restart the database after making those changes to the configuration.\n",
    "- Substitute in your file path to the `neo4j_import_folder` variable in the *Prep* codeblock under *Download Data*. \n",
    "  - This file path can be found through Neo4j Desktop (... > Open folder > DBMS > import). I will open this directory in Finder then select \"New Terminal at Folder\" and `pwd` to copy and paste the full path. \n",
    "- Manually copy the `opm_onet_crosswalk.csv` file from this repository into the Neo4j DBMS import folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure your Neo4j database is started before running this code.  \n",
    "When this code is ran, it:\n",
    "- Downloads data from ONET, ESCO and NICE in the form of CSVs into the Neo4j import folder. **Remember to change `download_new_data` flag to True.**\n",
    "- Cleans all data in the Neo4j import folder in preparation for upload. \n",
    "- Clears a local **existing and running** Neo4j graph database, then uploads the newly downloaded and cleaned data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### To Do\n",
    "- Incorporate [ONET Crosswalks](https://www.onetcenter.org/crosswalks.html).\n",
    "- Possibly incorporate USA Jobs. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Cahnges in code to run in MemGraph\n",
    "- apoc.periodic.iterate -> periodic.iterate\n",
    "- WITH HEADERS -> WITH HEADER and move after csv file location\n",
    "- batchSize -> batch_size and only accepts one parameter, number in batch\n",
    "- YIELD operation did not work, changed to YIELD * RETURN * for now\n",
    "- added some functions specifically for mage and constraints"
